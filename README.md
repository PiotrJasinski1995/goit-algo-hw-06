## Task 1
Graph of paths leading to cities.

## Task 2
Program that uses the DFS and BFS algorithms to find paths in the graph:
- we can see that DFS visit the next required node that is a neighbor of the previously visited,
- BFS starts with selected node and visits all of its neighbors before moving on to the next neighbor of those neighbors.

## Task 3
Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in the graph.
